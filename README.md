Hello!!

Just wanted to document some of the changelogs.

12/29/23 [
    --Version 3.0.1 [Project:2023-Update]

```diff
Changes:

+ Replaced some media with new versions.

+ Updated panels.

+ Condensed CSS and removed filters for certain panels to help counter lag on lower-end and mobile devices.
```

    --Version 3.0!! [Fission-Update]

```diff
New:

+ New loading animation! This should aid with loading times and make for an interesting entrance.

+ New bento opener! Mini-browser, mini-projects, mini-newsfeed, and links are now much easier to access.

+ Added nnexsus.net/quicklinks as a linktree clone!

+ Images are finally viewable in the News & Updates feed!

+ Fully custom mobile style (it actually works)!

+ Extreme amount of design micro-polish!

Changes:

+ Browser rework! Pages are meaningful now!

+ Initiatives moved to Past Projects, replacing Games section.

+ Fixed issues with images and embeds from Twitter and Discord eating an upwards 30Mb on load.

+ Fixed issues with everything, lol. There was a lot, can't even remember all of it.

Removed:

- Removed planet selector opener.

- Removed web planet page.

- Removed game planet page.

- Removed desktop panel.

- Removed all desktop apps.

- Removed theater panel.

- Removed several other interferring, padding, or generally unnecessary elements.
```

The fission update was aimed towards two things: 1. Fix the site speed, lag, and loading problems. 2. Try something new.
Eventually, as I was redesigning the site, I realized that more than 50% of the site was useless bloat, and there were easier ways around.
It isn't the first top-down redesign, and it won't be the last. Moving forward, I'll likely be sticking to this framework. Hope you enjoy!

--Version 2.5! [Photon-Update]

+ Theater 2.1! The theater app now has its own custom player, which includes controls, context menus, and a quick player bar!

+ Discord feed panel filters! The discord feed panel has new filters and channels that should make sorting between news, updates, and for which specific service much quicker.

+ Initiatives Panel! Check under the Showcase (previous Past Projects) panel to check my initiatives, which are essentially any kind of storm chases I've done. This will essentially serve as a mini-blog/log.

+ Youtube Site in Desktop 'Internet Explorer' App now has a playlist selector!

+ Added the Site History app to the Desktop panel, which shows a quick rundown of this readme file. In the future, though, I'd like to make some sort of timeline there.

+ The Current Projects & Past Projects panels have been backended for continous updates (without needed to update the entire site)!

>> No more messing around. Full design changes and functionality to mobile without workarounds now. For real, no more forced scale.

>> Past Projects has been renamed to Showcase, and the panel has had its designed reworked once again to assist with mobile AND to modernize the panel.

>> A few panels have more redundancy (appear more than 1 place) on the site to reduce navigation time!

>> Design changes to multiple instructional elements to help with navigation.

>> A few design elements are now time reactive, and I have further plans for this too.

>> Updated nnserver panel for missing Amethyst Update info.

>> Many design fixes and updates, including style downsizing.

>> Massive decrease in loading and performance times, as well as a continous downsize on the network download and resource size.
    2.5: | Download Size: 4.7Mb first visit, 637Kb on returns! | 8Mb Resource Size | Max Average Loading Time 2.73s (over modern speeds) | 

- Removed the Fish Game panel. Fish Game has been down for quite a bit now, and while I do plan to work on the update and get it back up, I have other priorities first.

- Removed Project: 22 Winners panel. In the future I'll have a place for this, probably on the Desktop app. For now, no reason to have to load all that.

I probably also missed quite a few significant enough changes to be on here during my workflow, lol.

--Version 2.4! [Valence-Update] //1 Year of nnexsus.net!! https://web.archive.org/web/20220417100459/https://www.nnexsus.net/ - April 2022 version

+ Added Cross-site recognition! Some panels, or other aspects of the site, may change if you've visited any of my other sites! (This uses cookies btw)

+ Added visited sites panel. Each site of mine you visit will update the panel, and unlock something for visiting all 4!

+ About Me 2.0! The about me panel is now updated and much better looking. (The old about-me was the original from the site launch this time last year....)

+ Desktop 2.0! The desktop, as well, is updated. Most apps have been deleted in favor of the GeoRadio in-app browser build. Apps listed below have been converted to sites:
[After Effects, VSCode, Twitter, Youtube, Weather].

+ Discord Feed 2.0! The original discord feeds were impossible to read. Now, I've incorporated markdown and my own stylings to make the panel usable! (I think it looks pretty dang good)

+ Theater 2.0! I've adapted a more 'youtube like' ui to the theater panel, and changed the way videos load, making it faster and a smaller download size!

>> Condensed Past Projects panel design.

>> Added ASCII designs for the Past Project panel nav buttons.

>> Various fixes to the photo-viewer, mostly design based.

>> New spring/early summer theme!

>> As always, a ton of other design fixes and updates, some very noticable this time, lol.

>> Somehow, despite adding more items yet again, the network size, RAM, and CPU usage of the site have all decreased.

- Removed After Effects, VSCode, Twitter, Youtube, and Weather Desktop Apps.

- Disabled Fish Game quick launch for the time being (until its update v1.1).
