--Version 2.4! [Valence-Update] //1 Year of nnexsus.net!! https://web.archive.org/web/20220417100459/https://www.nnexsus.net/ - April 2022 version

+ Added Cross-site recognition! Some panels, or other aspects of the site, may change if you've visited any of my other sites! (This uses cookies btw)

+ Added visited sites panel. Each site of mine you visit will update the panel, and unlock something for visiting all 4!

+ Desktop 2.0! The desktop, as well, is updated. Most apps have been deleted in favor of the GeoRadio in-app browser build. Apps listed below have been converted to sites:
[After Effects, VSCode, Twitter, Youtube, Weather].

+ Discord Feed 2.0! The original discord feeds were impossible to read. Now, I've incorporated markdown and my own stylings to make the panel usable! (I think it looks pretty dang good)

- Removed After Effects, VSCode, Twitter, Youtube, and Weather Desktop Apps.

- Disabled Fish Game quick launch for the time being (until its update v1.1).
